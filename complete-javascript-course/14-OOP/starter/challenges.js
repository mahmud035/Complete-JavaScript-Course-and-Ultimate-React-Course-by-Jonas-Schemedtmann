//* Coding Challenge #1

/* 
  1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
  2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
  3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
  4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

  DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
  DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
